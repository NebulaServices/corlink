# Basic Setup 

To get started with Corlink you need 3 things:

- A Corlink API key.
- A website ready to go.
- A way to interact with the API (express, fastify, etc).

## Corlink API Key 

To get a Corlink API key, you can either:
- [Self-host Corlink](./7.selfhosting/)
- Use the public Corlink API provided by Ruby Network

If you choose to self-host Corlink, you can find the setup instructions [here](./7.selfhosting/).
If you choose to use the public Corlink API, you need to join the [Ruby Network Discord server](https://dsc.gg/rubynetwork) and open a ticket about use of the public API.
