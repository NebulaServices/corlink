# Corlink API Server

This is the server that handles all the requests and responses. Want to see the docs for the API? [Click here](/).

## Setup

There are 6 ways of setting up the Corlink API server:

- [Docker](#docker)
- [Docker Compose](#docker-compose-recommended)
- [AUR](#aur)
- [Go Install](#go-install)
- [Manual](#manual)

## Docker 

This is one of the easiest ways to get the Corlink API server up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- A PostgreSQL database. (See setup [here](./5.database.md))

### Steps

1. Pull the image.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/ruby-network/corlink-server:latest
```

2. Run the image.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e ADMIN_KEY=your_admin_key -e DB_HOST=your_db_host -e DB_USER=your_db_user -e DB_PASS=your_db_password -e DB_NAME=your_db_name -e DB_PORT=your_db_port ghcr.io/ruby-network/corlink-server:latest
```

## Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the recommended way of setting up the Corlink API server. It is the easiest and fastest way to get the Corlink API server up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Steps

1. Acquire the `docker-compose.yml` file from the Corlink repository.
   - You can find the file [here](https://github.com/ruby-network/corlink/blob/main/licensing/docker-compose.yml).

2. Setup the folders for the database and other volumes where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located.   

```bash
mkdir -p db/
```

3. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` files environment variables.

::alert{type="danger"}
When changing the `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB` variables, you will also need to change the `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_NAME` variables in the `corlink-server` service.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
Make sure to change the `ADMIN_KEY` to a secure key. Below is a command to generate a secure key.
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```
::

| Variable | Description | Service |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | The user of the database. (Default is fine) | `postgres` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | The password of the database. (Default is fine) | `postgres` |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | The name of the database. (Default is fine) | `postgres` |
| `ADMIN_KEY` | The admin key for the Corlink API. | `corlink-server` |
| `DB_HOST` | The host of the database. **LEAVE DEFAULT** | `corlink-server` |
| `DB_USER` | The user of the database. (default value is fine) | `corlink-server` |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | The password of the database. (default value is fine) | `corlink-server` |
| `DB_NAME` | The name of the database. (default value is fine) | `corlink-server` |
| `DB_PORT` | The port of the database. (default value is fine) | `corlink-server` |

4. Run the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

5. You should now have a Corlink API server running.

## AUR 

This is another easy way to get the Corlink API server up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/download/)
- [Yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) (or any other AUR helper, or manual installation (figure that out yourself *nerd*))
- A PostgreSQL database. (See setup [here](./5.database.md))

### Steps

1. Install the package.

```bash
yay -S corlink-server
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the directory you would like to run the server in.

```
ADMIN_KEY=your_admin_key
DB_HOST=your_db_host
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASS=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_PORT=your_db_port
```

3. Run the package.

```bash
corlink-server start
```

::alert{type="info"}
You can also use a SQLite database (not recommended for prod) by adding the `-s` or `--sqlite` flag to the `corlink-server start` command.
::

4. You should now have a Corlink API server running.

## Go Install 

This is another easy way to get the Corlink API server up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- A PostgreSQL database. (See setup [here](./5.database.md))

### Steps

1. Install the package.

```bash
go install github.com/ruby-network/corlink/licensing@latest
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the directory you would like to run the server in.

```env 
ADMIN_KEY=your_admin_key
DB_HOST=your_db_host
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASS=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name
DB_PORT=your_db_port
```

3. Run the package.

```bash
corlink-server start
```

::alert{type="info"}
You can also use a SQLite database (not recommended for prod) by adding the `-s` or `--sqlite` flag to the `corlink-server start` command.
